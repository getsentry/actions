# actions
A collection of reusable GitHub Actions for Sentry. Note that actions prefixed with `sentry-` are going to be [getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) specific, *but* it can be used outside of that repo. For example, [getsentry/snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba) may use it to setup integration test w/ `getsentry/sentry`.
